# PLDAC19
Projet PLDAC 2019 - Interrogation SPARQL/RDF en Langage Naturel.

For your information, my fellow and I did not start this project from scratch, the subject was not simple and we needed something to rely on, so our referent teacher made up a recommendation to start with this project :  https://github.com/ayoungprogrammer/nlquery.

That we've done for a whole semester is to add new functionnalities about translation in SPARQL, we've made the program more consistent, we've added a whole user interface and a feedback system.

If you are still interested, you can check our report but it's written in French.
